\subsection{Miscellaneous}

When I was in my very young age, I was quite confused with the definition of a group homomorphism. The requirement of \(\phi(g)\phi(h)=\phi(gh)\) sounds from nowhere. It is until years later that I've realised the vague rhetorical concept that "Homomorphisms preserve structures". To formalise, one may say \(G\in \cat{0}{Grp}\), \(\phi(G)=\oIm (\phi)\in \cat{0}{Grp}\). \\

Let's think about a childish question: Why is morphisms (or for the convenience of thinking, morphisms in \(\cat{1}{Set}\) denoted as \(\to\)? Imagine the significance of an arrow, it "shoots into" another object, and thereby

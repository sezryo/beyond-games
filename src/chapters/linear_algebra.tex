\section{Finite vector spaces}
For a given field F, finite dimensioned vector spaces are \textbf{trivial} up to an equivalence in \(\cat{1}{Vect_F}\). \\
Note that, let \( V \in \cat{0}{Vect_F} \) and \(\odim(V)=k<\omega \), essentially \(V \iso{Vect_F} F^k \)

Later it may be proved that, for any two normed vector spaces on the same field, they also isomorphic to the extent of \(\cat{1}{Vect_F}\)?

\section{Dual Spaces}
A very useful way of thinking what a dual space is in our common finite \(V\iso{Vect_F} F^n\) is:
\begin{lemma}
  \(\big(\begin{smallmatrix}
    a_1 & a_2 & \ldots & a_n 
  \end{smallmatrix}\big) \corres \big(\begin{smallmatrix}
                                         a_1\\
                                         a_2\\
                                         \ldots\\
                                         a_n
                                       \end{smallmatrix}\big)\, ; \quad V \corres V^{\star}\)
\end{lemma}

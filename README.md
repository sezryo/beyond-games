## Beyond Games :: Gently weird notes took in Cambridge

This is my personal lecture notes for the mathematical tripos in Cambridge. 
Typically, I take zero systematic notes on lectures, written or typed, but now I would like to re-factorise some of my flaky notes into a readable (not really) incarnation of my narcissistic maths ideology and aesthetics.

Special Thanks to the public notes that help my study a lot:
